# Aleph Alpha Intelligence Layer ‚òØÔ∏è

The Aleph Alpha Intelligence Layer ‚òØÔ∏è offers a comprehensive suite of development tools for crafting solutions that harness the capabilities of large language models (LLMs).
With a unified framework for LLM-based workflows, it facilitates seamless AI product development, from prototyping and prompt experimentation to result evaluation and deployment.

The key features of the Intelligence Layer are:

- **Best practices** We provide you with **_state-of-the-art_** methods tailored for prevalent LLM use cases.
  Utilize our off-the-shelf techniques to swiftly prototype based on your primary data.
  Our approach integrates the best industry practices, allowing for optimal performance.
- **Composability**: The Intelligence Layer streamlines your journey from prototyping to scalable deployment.
  It offers seamless integration with diverse evaluation methods, manages concurrency, and orchestrates smaller tasks into complex workflows.
- **Auditability** At the core of the Intelligence Layer is the belief that all AI processes must be auditable and traceable.
  To ensure this, we provide full coprehensibility, by seamlessly logging each step of every workflow.
  This enhances your debugging capabilities and offers greater control post-deployment when examining model responses.
