				"text": "Robert Moses''' (December 18, 1888 – July 29, 1981) was an American [[urban planner]] and public official who worked in the [[New York metropolitan area]] during the early to mid 20th century. Despite never being elected to any office, Moses is regarded as one of the most powerful and influential individuals in the history of New York City and New York State. The grand scale of his infrastructural projects and his philosophy of urban development influenced a generation of engineers, architects, and urban planners across the United States.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nMoses held various positions throughout his more than forty-year long career.

These roadways and bridges, alongside [[urban renewal]] efforts that saw the destruction of huge swaths of tenement housing and their replacement with large [[New York City Housing Authority|public housing projects]], transformed the physical fabric of New York and inspired other cities to undertake similar development endeavors.\n\nMoses's reputation declined following the publication of [[Robert Caro]]'s [[Pulitzer Prize]]-winning biography ''[[The Power Broker]]'' (1974), which cast doubt on the purported benefits of many of Moses's projects and further cast Moses as racist.
