**Subject Matter of the Agreement:** Aleph Alpha GmbH ("Aleph Alpha"), a company specializing in the development of artificial intelligence
applications, provides the Customer named below with a product that is still under development ("Test Product") free of charge for test use based
on the terms of this contract ("Test Use"). The Customer is aware that this is a Test Product which is not yet fully functional, may not function
properly, may contain errors and may therefore deliver incorrect results.

**Right of Use:** Aleph Alpha grants to the Customer for the agreed term a simple, non-exclusive, limited to installation in the European Union, non-
transferable right of use of the Test Product for test purposes. The Test Product may not be used in the active, operational area of the Customer,
but only within the framework of "non-production use" for test purposes. This means that the Test Product may not be made generally available
to users in the Customer's company and to third parties for regular use, for example in the operational process or for the provision of a service
internally or externally. The Customer has the right to install the Test Product on its IT infrastructure or at a third party ("on-premise"). The
Customer is also not entitled to decompile, disassemble, or perform any other form of so-called reverse engineering of the Test Product.
Feedback: The Customer provides Aleph Alpha with feedback on the Test Product and Aleph Alpha is entitled to use this feedback free of charge.
In this regard, the Customer grants Aleph Alpha a spatially and temporally unlimited, irrevocable, non-exclusive and royalty-free right to use
Customer's feedback.

**Confidentiality Obligation:** Both parties will (a) not disclose to any third party any confidential information of the other party that the other party
discloses in written, oral or electronic form, unless the disclosing party has consented in writing to the disclosure or the disclosure is otherwise
permitted under this Section, (b) protect the Disclosing Party's Confidential Information with the same care that is used to protect their own
Confidential Information of a similar nature; and (c) disclose Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party only to its employees, affiliates and
consultants who have a need to know and who are sufficiently bound by confidentiality. Both parties agree that the confidentiality obligations shall
outlast the termination or expiration of this contract.

**Indemnification for Third Party Claims:** Aleph Alpha will defend the Customer against any claim brought against the Customer by a third party
alleging that the Test Product infringes a valid protection right of the third party (a "Claim Against Customer"), and Aleph Alpha will indemnify the
Customer against all claims for damages, attorneys' fees and costs finally awarded against the Customer as a result of a Claim Against Customer or
for amounts paid by the Customer under a settlement approved in writing by Aleph Alpha, provided that the Customer: (i) gives Aleph Alpha
prompt written notice of the Claim Against Customer, (ii) gives Aleph Alpha sole control of the defense and settlement of the Claim Against
Customer, and (iii) provides all reasonable assistance to Aleph Alpha at Aleph Alpha's expense. The foregoing defense and indemnification
obligations shall not apply if (i) the allegation does not expressly state that the Test Product is the basis of the claim against the customer, (ii) a
claim against the Customer arises from the use or the combination of the Test Product or any part thereof with software, hardware, data or
processes not provided by Aleph Alpha, if the Test Product or use thereof would not constitute an infringement but for such combination, (iii) a
claim against the Customer arises from a Test Product that the Customer receives free of charge, or (iv) a claim against the Customer arises from
Customer Data, a Third Party Application or a breach of this contract.
Limitation of Liability: The use of the Test Product is at the Customer's sole risk. Aleph Alpha is liable without limitation for damages resulting from
intentional or grossly negligent misconduct of the legal representatives or vicarious agents, resulting from the breach of a warranty assumed by
the respective party, resulting from a fraudulently concealed defect, resulting from injury to life, body or health, as well as according to the German
Product Liability Act. In all other respects, liability is excluded to the extent legally possible or, if an exclusion is not effective, limited to EUR
1,000.00.

**Term and Termination:** The Term starts with Customerâ€™s access to the download link to the Test Product and ends automatically after three (3)
months unless Aleph Alpha confirmed a longer Term in an email. This contract is valid for the duration of the Test Use by the Customer. After the
expiration of this Agreement, Customer has to delete the Test Product.

**General Provisions**: This contract and any claim, dispute or controversy arising out of or relating to this contract shall be governed by and construed
in accordance with the laws of Germany. The courts of Heidelberg, Germany shall have exclusive jurisdiction to settle any dispute or claim arising
out of or in connection with this contract (including non-contractual disputes or claims). The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the
International Sale of Goods shall not apply to the extent permitted. If any provision of this contract is found by a court of competent jurisdiction
to be invalid or unenforceable, such provisions shall be deemed null and void and the remaining provisions of this contract shall remain in full force
and effect. The parties agree that this contract may be agreed to online or executed by electronic signatur
