Despite never being elected to any office, Moses is regarded as one of the most powerful and influential individuals in the history of New York City and New York State. The grand scale of his infrastructural projects and his philosophy of urban development influenced a generation of engineers, architects, and urban planners across the United States.<ref name=\":0\" />\n",

As head of the [[MTA Bridges and Tunnels|Triborough Bridge Authority]], Moses had near-complete control over bridges and tunnels in New York City as well as the tolls collected from them, and built, among others, the [[Robert F. Kennedy Bridge|Triborough Bridge]], the [[Brooklyn–Battery Tunnel]], and the [[Throgs Neck Bridge]], as well as several major highways. These roadways and bridges, alongside [[urban renewal]] efforts that saw the destruction of huge swaths of tenement housing and their replacement with large [[New York City Housing Authority|public housing projects]], transformed the physical fabric of New York and inspired other cities to undertake similar development endeavors.\n",

A member of the Republican Party and the wealthy Rockefeller family, he previously served as the 49th governor of New York from 1959 to 1973. Rockefeller also served as assistant secretary of State for American Republic Affairs for Presidents Franklin D. Roosevelt and Harry S.

In his time, liberals in the Republican Party were called \"Rockefeller Republicans\". As Governor of New York from 1959 to 1973, Rockefeller's achievements included the expansion of the State University of New York (SUNY), efforts to protect the environment, the construction of the Empire State Plaza in Albany, increased facilities and personnel for medical care, and the creation of the New York State Council on the Arts.\n",

Rockefeller was the second vice president appointed to the position under the 25th Amendment, following Ford himself. Rockefeller did not seek a full term on the 1976 Republican ticket with Ford. He retired from politics in 1977 and died two years later.\n",
