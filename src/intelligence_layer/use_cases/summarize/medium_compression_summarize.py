However, in Baden-W端rttemberg in particular, traditional industries still account for around 30% of gross domestic product, which means that, like other regions, it is massively threatened by structural change (Statistisches Landesamt Baden-W端rttemberg 2021).",

The results show that the global average price has fallen by two percent to USD 9.30 per month. The development varies greatly from region to region. In the Commonwealth of Independent States, the average price has risen by almost half in just one year, to the equivalent of 5.70 US dollars. In the Americas, prices have risen by ten percent to an average of $14.70.

No wonder, since the Chinese company is subject to U.S. sanctions and cannot obtain new hardware or software from the U.S. and some other Western countries. Exports are also restricted. Nevertheless, the company's headquarters in Shenzhen reported a lower debt ratio, a 68 percent increase in operating profit and even a 76 percent increase in net profit for 2021. Will Huawei's record profit go down in the history books as the Miracle of Shenzhen despite the slump in sales? Will the brave Chinese be able to outsmart the tech-hungry Americans? Are export bans proving to be a boomerang, hurting the U.S. export business while Huawei prints more money than ever before?",
