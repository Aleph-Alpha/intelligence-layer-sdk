    "In the following, we focus on comparing setups which differ only in the chosen model.\n",
    "\n",
    "We provide multiple inputs consisting of a longer texts and a questions related to each of those texts, as well as the expected answers.\n",
    "A Llama-model is used as a grader to decide which answer of two different models is better.\n",
    "The aggregation of all comparisons results in [ELO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elo_rating_system) scores and win rates of the models.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we go through the following steps: First, we create a set of examples of texts with a relevant question for each (Step 0), after which we use the models to generate answers (Step 1). The given answers are then compared against each other and judged by the Llama model (Step 2), which will result in a final ELO ranking and win rate (Step 3). Lastly, we include a new model in the evaluation without having to re-evaluate the previous models against each other, as is typically done in ELO rankings (Step 4).\n",

    "Generally, polysilicon is used as one of the substrate layers while silicon dioxide is used as a sacrificial layer. The sacrificial layer is removed or etched out to create any necessary void in the thickness direction. Added layers tend to vary in size from 2-5 micrometres. The main advantage of this machining process is the ability to build electronic and mechanical components (functions) on the same substrate. Surface micro-machined components are smaller compared to their bulk micro-machined counterparts.\n",
    "\n",
    "As the structures are built on top of the substrate and not inside it, the substrate's properties are not as important as in bulk micro-machining. Expensive silicon wafers can be replaced by cheaper substrates, such as glass or plastic. The size of the substrates may be larger than a silicon wafer, and surface micro-machining is used to produce thin-film transistors on large area glass substrates for flat panel displays. This technology can also be used for the manufacture of thin film solar cells, which can be deposited on glass, polyethylene terepthalate substrates or other non-rigid materials.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fabrication process\n",

    "Micro-machining starts with a silicon wafer or other substrate upon which new layers are grown. These layers are selectively etched by photo-lithography; either a wet etch involving an acid, or a dry etch involving an ionized gas (or plasma). Dry etching can combine chemical etching with physical etching or ion bombardment. Surface micro-machining involves as many layers as are needed with a different mask (producing a different pattern) on each layer. Modern integrated circuit fabrication uses this technique and can use as many as 100 layers. Micro-machining is a younger technology and usually uses no more than 5 or 6 layers. Surface micro-machining uses developed technology (although sometimes not enough for demanding applications) which is easily repeatable for volume production.\"\"\"\n",
