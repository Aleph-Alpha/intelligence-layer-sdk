Despite never being elected to any office, Moses is regarded as one of the most powerful and influential individuals in the history of New York City and New York State. The grand scale of his infrastructural projects and his philosophy of urban development influenced a generation of engineers, architects, and urban planners across the United States.<ref name=\":0\" />\n",

As Long Island State Park Commissioner, Moses oversaw the construction of [[Jones Beach State Park]], the most visited public beach in the United States,<ref name=\"Jones Beach\">{{cite news |url=http://www.longislandexchange.com/jones-beach.html |website=Long Island Exchange |title=Jones Beach |access-date=November 21, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130121130008/http://www.longislandexchange.com/jones-beach.html |archive-date=January 21, 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref> and was the primary architect of the [[Parkways in New York|New York State Parkway System]]. As head of the [[MTA Bridges and Tunnels|Triborough Bridge Authority]], Moses had near-complete control over bridges and tunnels in New York City as well as the tolls collected from them, and built, among others, the [[Robert F. Kennedy Bridge|Triborough Bridge]], the [[Brooklyn–Battery Tunnel]], and the [[Throgs Neck Bridge]], as well as several major highways. These roadways and bridges, alongside [[urban renewal]] efforts that saw the destruction of huge swaths of tenement housing and their replacement with large [[New York City Housing Authority|public housing projects]], transformed the physical fabric of New York and inspired other cities to undertake similar development endeavors.\n",

A member of the Republican Party and the wealthy Rockefeller family, he previously served as the 49th governor of New York from 1959 to 1973.
